# Remote Controlling Car Model

This project is the final project of my Computer Interfacing subject when I was a student in Hanoi University of Science and Technology.

This project is scored 10/10.

# Overview

I designed and developed an embedded system on a Car Model. This Car Model can be controlled by a PC using keyboard or by a Smartphone using speech.

I designed and developed a Lua-based firmware on the Wi-Fi module ESP8266 for communicating between PC/Smartphone and the Car Model.

I designed and developed C-based firmware on ATmega16 which executes commands from PC/Smartphone to control the Car Model.
